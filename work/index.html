		<h1>Visual Design</h1>
		<h4>Spring 2017 | Adobe Illustrator</h4>
		<p class = "headers"> What <p>
		<p class = "description">A collection of growing visual creations in an attempt to sharpen my Illustrator skills while exploring art as a digital medium, many of which are an homage to my new home at Cal.</p>
		<p class = "headers"> Why <p>
		<p class = "description">Throughout high school, my interactions with visual design
		only manifested in roles of <a href = "https://issuu.com/journeysmagazine/docs/journeysmagazine2016">directing designers</a> themselves. Although I always wanted to
		explore digital art in more handson ways, I never had access to Adobe products.</p>
		<p class = "description">At Berkeley, the <a href = "http://stc.berkeley.edu/">Student Technology Council</a> offers free software downloads, which includes the whole Adobe Creative Suite. </p>

					Popsicles melt. And so does summer. I was simply thinking about the transience of lazy summer days leading up to my work. You should eat your popsicles while they're fresh, and spend your days wisely.

		<p class = "headers"> Reflections </p>
		<p class = "description">I didn't know what to expect when beginning Illustrator, but I didn't brace for the steep learning curve ahead. Although initially overwhelmed by the seemingly endless variations of tools and the foreign interface of Adobe products, I've begun to accept process of visual design as a very sophisticated art of clever problem-solving. I feel more confident to take on design projects, big or small.</p>
		<p class = "description">
		My designs are by no means perfect, but I hope that practice and persistence will allow me to continue to grow in my skills. </p>
